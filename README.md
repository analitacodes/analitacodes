- 👋 Hi, I’m @warlita and I am very new to coding. Learning to make a career pivot into the developer world. 
- 👀 I’m interested in anime, reading, journaling, Brazillian Jiujitsu, and yoga. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML/CSS as I begin this coding journey. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on with anyone that is also making a pivot and would like to study/learn together. 
- 📫 How to reach me: for now on here is great. I'm a newbie.
